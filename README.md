# C---Trie-Autocomplete-implementation
I haven't seen an autocomplete for Trie implemented in C, so here is my beginner attempt at it.
NOTE: you must choose your own diciontary of words to input.
      the dictionary must be limited to A-Z, a-z, and apostrophe (eg. Bison's, Jimmy's, alfredo, mother, etc.)
